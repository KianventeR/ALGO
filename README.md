## Deployment

1. (Preferably) Install the latest version of Java SDK and Java JRE. 
2. In your console of choice, change directory to the folder where the `.jar` file or `.exe` file named ALGO is located. 
3. Run the the program using the commands listed below depending if you use the `.jar` file or the `.exe` file (Windows).

### Jar File Execution
1. For other OS with Java installed, type the following: `java -jar ALGO.jar`

### Exe File (Windows users only)
1. Simply type the following: `start ALGO.exe`

###
You can also run the jar and/or exe files by simply opening either of the files.


## Test Case File Format

1. You can import a `.txt` file to extract inputs for the different CPU Scheduling Algorithms
2. format should be: `<Process ID>`,`<Burst Time>`,`<Arrival Time>`,`<Priority>`,
```
P1,2,3,3,
P2,1,2,1,
P3,3,1,2,
```
